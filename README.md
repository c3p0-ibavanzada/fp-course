# F#: your first functional programming language

> This is a work in progress.

These guides are oriented to those progammers interested in learning some concepts on functional programming, 
from a practical perspective. F\# is an excelent _first_ functional programming language: it is functional (of course), 
it has a clean and readable syntax (not a lot of fancy symbols and stuff), it is flexible (in case you need to grasp 
some other paradigm in the middle of your code) and it is concise enough to express your ideas with clarity. 

Learning a new language _and_ a new programming paradigm is a wonderful adventure. You do not need any special preparation, 
although I assume that the reader has some background in at least one popular language (let us say C, Python, Java or JavaScript, for example).
