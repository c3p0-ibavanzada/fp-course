The first one is that the function flattens  the inputs (such as in the case of `changeValue`), where one gets the float value of the money the user receives. The second one corresponds to a function that  promotes the input types to another one: for example, the trivial case would be a function that prints the amount of money the customer receives, `printChange: Change -> ()`, that is, receives a `Change` and returns `unit`. \n",
