    "These guides are oriented to those progammers interested in learning some concepts on functional programming, from a practical perspective. F\\# is an excelent _first_ functional programming language: it is functional (of course), it has a clean and readable syntax (not a lot of fancy symbols and stuff), it is flexible (in case you need to grasp some other paradigm in the middle of your code) and it is concise enough to express your ideas with clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning a new language _and_ a new programming paradigm is a wonderful adventure. You do not need any special preparation, although I assume that the reader has some background in at least one popular language (let us say C, Python, Java or JavaScript, for example). Hope you enjoy your journey as much as I did when I started with F\\# a few years ago. Rembember to code and make mistakes, for there is where the learning transforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "F\\#, as every other computer language, has it own syntax and peculiarities that one needs to understand. But learning the functional paradigm requires to set aside a few concepts that one is very fond of and uses in everyday coding in imperative or object oriented languages. \n",

    "> In the beginning, there where two mutually equivalent approaches to formal computing, one developed by Alan Turing with his [computing machine](https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230), while the other one was worked out by Alonzo Church with his [lambda calculus](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2371045?origin=crossref&seq=10#metadata_info_tab_contents). \n",

    "So the first step in a new language is to learn how to define a way to hold your data, and how to transform it along the code. The former concept usually translates into _variables_ and while the latter one into _routines_, (or any other name, such as procedures, or functions, depending your programming scope). In this way, one uses routines to change the variables, or create other ones, from an order to buy something in a website, to the color of a pixel in your game of choice. \n",
