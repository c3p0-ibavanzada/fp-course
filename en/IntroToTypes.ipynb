    "To completely define a function, you not only need to establish its behavior, but also its inputs and outputs. That is what _types_ are for! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking with types\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered the basics of functions in F\\#, and defined some properties that difference them from routines or procedures in other languages. We have also seen how one can combine functions together. That is the first aspect about defining functions: how they behave, and how one can encapsulate this behavior in one or several functions that can be composed to generate results. In our example, the behavior of our `vendingMachine` is to give you some product once you provided enough money and selected your treat with a keyboard. \n",
    "The second aspect that is _needed_ to define the function is what sort of inputs and outputs it has. Going back to our first example, one had a table that represented the function `carColor`, with the color of each car in parked in a block. A completely different function would be `carHorsePower`, where for each car in the block, you write down the horsepower. Clearly here the inputs of both functions are the same, the license plate, but the outputs are different. If our vending machine does not take paper bills but credit cards, the input will be different, but you still get your beloved chips, that is, the outputs of `vendingMachine` and the modern `vendingMachineWithCreditCard` are of the same kind, but the inputs are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to completely define a function, you need to specify (code...) the behavior of the function _and_ the types of inputs and outputs. These are two sides of the same coin, and one cannot live without the other. And that is where the type of inputs and a outputs of the real world need to be properly represented by your code. And that is where the language provides you with the tools to define these types. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to define the kind of inputs and outputs of your functions? To start, typically one writes down a bullet list of all the relevant characteristics of them. In the case of colors of the cars in the block, the inputs are the license plates that usually are letters and numbers, so in our code model, that would be some kind of string. How about the outputs? One can use the usual color names, as we did. That would be represented by a collection of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Or, one can go for more detail and use the names of the colors [each car model has](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28196287/wildest-paint-colors-for-sale/). That would be a more complete collection of colors, but this also would affect the inputs of our function, because we need now also the name of the car model. Going further, the name of the color probably changes with the years model, so we would need that too. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ❓ Can you come up with the inputs and outputs of a function `carModel`? This function identifies the model of a car in the block. Start with a minimal description, and then go into more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ❓ Take the real world examples of functions that you wrote down in the previous chapter, and try to define their inputs and outputs.\n",

    "For our vending machine with bills, our inputs are going to be the number of bills of each denomination  introduced in the machine, and a letter and a number to determine which product the customer wants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of bills of each denomination\n",
    "- A letter\n",
    "- A number \n",

    "- The product type (chocolate, chips, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "and also a number of bills if the machine gives change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a vending machine with credit cards, our input will be slightly different, since we need to model a credit card with\n",

    "- Card number\n",

    "A _type_ is the tool the computer languages provides to group or aggregate the properties of the model of any entity of our domain. As we all know, computers only understand only 0s and 1s bits at the lowest level, however, they are presented typically as chunks _bytes_ of 8 bits each. Putting bytes together one can have the basic types of all languages, such as integer and float numbers in all of their variations (signed or unsigned integers, integers of different size, float numbers of different sizes). Other basic types, such as strings or chars, even booleans, depend on the way each language implements them. \n",
    "\n",
    "All contemporary languages can build compound types using these basic types. For example, if we need to model a wallet, we will need a way to represent money bills, credit cards, personal id, etc. Each of these elements in turn needs also to be modeled, and so on. Therefore, the wallet will be represented as a hierarchical aggregation of simpler models that, at the very bottom of it, will resort to basic types. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also another aspect of modelling the real world entities with types to look at. Let us go back to our examples and examine how we can map each of the properties of our models into simpler types. Clearly the cardholder's name of a credit card can be a string, the expiration date is, well, a date. \n",
    "How about the type of the product? In principle can also be a string too. However, it seems that one can be more specific: for a food vending machine, one can make a bullet list of the possible food types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- chips\n",
    "- chocolate\n",
    "- candy\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. There are also electronics vending machines, so one would have\n",
    "\n",
    "- phone\n",
    "- speakers\n",
    "- headphones\n",
    "etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bullet list can be long, but probably one can write it down in a page (or, maybe it is provided by your vending machine client). \n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like one can classify the features of inputs and outputs more broadly. On one hand, the cardholder's name of a credit card and expiration dates are huge collections that can not be determined _a priori_. On the other hand, we have some features that belong to a well predefined collection (car colors, types of products). Notice also that these two kind of types can be compound together in inputs or outputs, like in the wallet model. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the greatest features of F\\# is that provides precise ways to implement these two kind of types. In the next sections we will see how to build these inputs and outputs in F\\#.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, the keyword that F\\# uses to build complex types is, of course, `type` ;-D. \n"

For example, printing something in the console is _not_ the output of the `printfn` function, but a side effect: the function does something that alters what is happening in the console. Your code is minding its own bussiness, but at some point, you decided to show some information on the console.

    "What functional programming does is to give you all the tools to prevent _undesired_ side effects in your code, but to produce _desired_ side effects when are needed. For example, a particular function in your code will receive some inmutable inputs and produce some new outputs. Then, if one restricts the attention to that function, anything outside the world of it remains unchanged, but a new value (the output) is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "In non-functional languages, the most common undesired side effect is to be able to change input values in a function. In most cases, these languages have the ability to pass arguments to a function as a reference (a pointer in C, for example) so one can change the values of it, which in turn will change the value of the argument variable.
