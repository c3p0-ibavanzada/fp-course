    "- [Fable](https://fable.io/), the amazing transpiler from F# to JavaScript (and lately, [other languages](https://fable.io/blog/2022/2022-06-06-Snake_Island_alpha.html). Is not just a compiler, but a way to use these languages together. Depending on the recipe you would like to prepare, add the ingredients at your own pleasure. Also, check [Fable REPL](https://fable.io/repl/), where you can sketch with F#, no installation of anything needed.\n",
    "-  [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/)  is kind of hard to define, but basically it enables you to build and/or interact with React components directly in F#. \n",
    "- [Feliz.Bulma](https://dzoukr.github.io/Feliz.Bulma) is a wrapper around the well-known [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework, tailored to the [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/) DSL.  \n",
