    "We have covered the basics of functions in F\\#, and defined some properties that difference them from routines or procedures in other languages. We also presented the primitive types as an example, but program with a reasonable chance of success, it is necessary for the language to be able to aggregate different primitive types in more complex ones. In the case of object oriented languages, one builds a hierarchy of classes that represent the domain one is working on. Those classes encapsulate not only data (that is described in types) but also their associated behavior through methods. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of functional F\\#, and other functional languages, there is no need to attach behavior to types. Let us remember that functions always receive inputs and _create_ outputs, and also, all values are inmutable. On the contrary, methods in a class are designed to change (that is, _mutate_) values of an instance of that class. \n",

In the vast majority of the cases, the compiler guess is correct.
