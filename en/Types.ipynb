    "To completely define a function, you not only need to establish its behavior, but also the inputs and outputs. That is where _types_ come! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking with types\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered the basics of functions in F\\#, and defined some properties that difference them from routines or procedures in other languages. We have also seen how one can combine functions together. That is the first aspect about defining functions: how they behave, and how one can encapsulate this behavior in one or several functions that can be composed to generate results. In our example, the behavior of our `vendingMachine` is to give you some product once you provided enough money and selected your treat with a keyboard. \n",
    "The second aspect that is _needed_ to define the function is what sort of inputs and outputs it has. Going back to our first example, one had a table that represented the function `carColor`, with the color of each car in parked in a block. A completely different function would be `carHorsePower`, where for each car in the block, you write down the horsepower. Clearly here the inputs of both functions are the same, the license plate, but the outputs are different. If our vending machine does not take paper bills but credit cards, the input will be different, but you still get your beloved chips, that is, the outputs of `vendingMachine` and the modern `vendingMachineWithCreditCard` are the same, but the inputs are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to completely define a function, you need to specify (code...) the behavior of the function _and_ the types of inputs and outputs. These are two sides of the same coin, and one cannot live without the other. And that is where the type of inputs and a outputs of the real world need to be properly represented by your code. And that is where the language provides you with the tools to define these types. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to define the kind of inputs and outputs of your functions? To start, typically one writes down a bullet list of all the relevant characteristics of them. In the case of colors of the cars in the block, the inputs are the license plates that usually are letters and numbers, so in our code model, that would be some kind of string. How about the outputs? One can use the usual color names, as we did. That would be represented by a collection of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Or, one can go for more detail and use the names of the colors [each car model has](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28196287/wildest-paint-colors-for-sale/). That would be a more complete collection of colors, but this also would affect the inputs of our function, because we need now also the name of the car model. Going further, the name of the color probably changes with the years model, so we would need that too. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Can you come up with the inputs and outputs of the `carHorsePower`? Start with a minimal description, and then go into more details. Would it be ok to represent the horse power as a positive floating point number? Is that enough? Or that is too many?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our vending machine with bills, our inputs are going to be the number of bills of each denomination  introduced in the machine, and a letter and a number to determine which product the customer wants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of bills of each denomination\n",
    "- A letter\n",
    "- A number \n",
    "\n",
    " The outputs are possible products, that can be minimallistically modeled by saying\n",
    "\n",
    "- The product brand\n",
    "- The product type (chocolate, chips, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a vending machine with credit cards, our input will be slightly different, since we need to model a credit card with\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carholder's name\n",
    "- Card number\n",
    "- Expiration date\n",
    "- CVV number \n",
    "\n",
    "A _type_ is the tool the computer languages provide to group or aggregate the properties of the model of any entity of our domain. As we all know, computers only understand only 0s and 1s bits at the lowest level, however, they are presented typically as chunks _bytes_ of 8 bits each. Putting bytes together one can have the basic types of all languages, such as integer and float numbers in all of their variations (signed or unsigned integers, integers of different size, float numbers of different sizes). Other basic types, such as strings or chars, even booleans, depend on the way each language implements them. \n",
    "\n",
    "All contemporary languages can build compound types using these basic types. For example, if we need to model a wallet, we will need a way to represent money bills, credit cards, personal id, etc. Each of these elements in turn needs also to be modeled, and so on. Therefore, the wallet will be represented as a hierarchical aggregation of simpler models that, at the very bottom of it, will resort to basic types. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also another aspect of modelling the real world entities with types that needs attention. Let us go back to our examples and examine how we can map each of the properties of our models into simpler types. Clearly the cardholder's name of a credit card can be a string, the expiration date is, well, a date. \n",
    "How about the type of the product? In principle can also be a string too. However, it seems that one can be more specific: for a food vending machine, one can make a bullet list of the possible food types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- chips\n",
    "- chocolate\n",
    "- candy\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. There are also electronics vending machines, so one would have\n",
    "\n",
    "- phone\n",
    "- speakers\n",
    "- headphones\n",
    "- etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bullet list can be long, but probably one can write it down in a page (or, maybe it is provided by your vending machine client). \n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like one can classify the characteristics of inputs and outputs more broadly. On one hand, the cardholder's name of a credit card and expiration dates are huge (even infinite) collections that can not be determined _a priori_. On the other hand, we have some features that belong to a well predefined collection (car colors, types of products). \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that these two kind of types can be compound together in inputs or outputs, according to the bullet lists we wrote down. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the greatest features of F\\# is to provide precise ways to implement these two kind of types. In the next sections we will see how to build these inputs and outputs in F\\#.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, the keyword that F\\# uses to build complex types is, of course, `type` ;-D. \n"

In the case of object oriented languages, one builds a hierarchy of classes that represent the domain one is working on. Those classes encapsulate not only data (that is described in types) but also their associated behavior through methods. In the case of functional F\\#, and other functional languages, there is no need to attach behavior to types.\n",

    "As said before, almost all programming languages provide an idea of aggregating simple types (strings, bools, ints, etc.) into more complex ones, which is needed to properly describe a domain. The basic data of a user (name, email, etc.) can be put together in a type, the email data (to, from, subject, text, etc.) in another one and so on. Combining these new types one can generate more and more complex ones, until you can build, for example, all the types needed for an email application. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important steps in programming is to study the domain one is working on, and to fully understand how one can describe that domain with data and the processes that manage those data. In object oriented programming one is allowed (even required) to glue related processes and data together in classes. In functional programming one focuses on how processes (that is, functions) relate different kinds of data (that is, types). Since data in functional programming is inmutable and functions create outputs from inputs, one needs to identify the processes of our domain and distill them into functions, with proper inputs and outputs, in such a way that one can combine those functions together by composing them properly. Therefore, the analysis of a process and it conversion into functions not only requires to define the rules and the logic of the creation of outputs from inputs, buy more importantly, to adequate stablish those inputs and outputs such that composition of functions can be used (see again this [beautiful picture example](https://mathinsight.org/function_machine_composition)).\n",
